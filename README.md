# Racing
 A simple game


# Directions:
Use python3 with pygame to launch src/racetrack.py

The arrow keys can control the car, and the car drives around and stuff. Nothing interesting.

Oh, C can stop the game cleanly in case the X doesn't work.

At some point L might do stuff, but probably not.

Space is going to be to fire lasers if I decide to add that. 

Space might also be to jump. 

Currently this project is written using pygame, but I'd like to transition it at least partially to use turtle. 
Best case senario I would remove pygame entirely in favor of turtle. Pygame is just a bit too slow, not that turtle is much faster.
